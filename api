POST always redirect (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get) - 303 See Other (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.3.3)# not for api users but for testong
All request replies with proper http header
status codes:
 200 OK: Success!
 201 Created: a common return code for a successful HTTP POST (or PUT in idempotent creations)
 202 Accepted: request was accepted, but has not fully been processed, yet. A common code to return for asynchronous calls.
 304 Not Modified: There was no new data to return (think: cache).
 400 Bad Request: Invalid Request. Error message will be returned to provide further details.
 401 Unauthorized: Authentication credentials were missing or incorrect.
 403 Forbidden: Valid request that was refused. Attempt to access a resource that the client does not have permission to. Error message will be returned to provide further details.
 404 Not Found: The URL requested is invalid or the resource requested, such as a story or a user, does not exists.
 406 Not Acceptable: Returned when parameters passed are correct in theory and individually, but when combined can not be satisfied because the combination makes no sense (e.g. cart_id from one user is used with a user_id from another user). If possible, an error message will be returned to provide further details.
 500 Internal Server Error: Something went horribly wrong and we were not smart enough to provide more details :) Hopefully a very rare response code.
 503 Service Unavailable: Servers are offline for maintenance or went down under load (oops).
