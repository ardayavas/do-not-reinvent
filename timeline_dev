1979 usenet: Newsgroup experiments first occurred in 1979.
1983 usenet: the number of UUCP hosts had grown to 550.
1984 usenet: the number of UUCP hosts nearly doubling to 940
1985 usenet: Widespread use of Usenet by the BBS community was facilitated by the introduction of UUCP feeds made possible by MS-DOS implementations of UUCP such as UFGATE (UUCP to FidoNet Gateway), FSUUCP and UUPC. The Network News Transfer Protocol, or NNTP, was introduced in 1985 to distribute Usenet articles over TCP/IP as a more flexible alternative to informal Internet transfers of UUCP traffic. Since the Internet boom of the 1990s, almost all Usenet distribution is over NNTP.
1993 usenet: the online service America Online began offering Usenet access to its tens of thousands, and later millions, of users. Since that time, the dramatic rise in the popularity of the Internet has brought a constant stream of new users—in some people's view, drowning out the old Usenet entirely. (Eternal September)
1995 usenet: Web-based archiving of Usenet posts began in 1995 at Deja News with a very large, searchable database.
1996 usenet: Daily Volume is 4.5 GB

2004 usenet: Daily Volume is 1.38 TB
2005 usenet: AOL announced that it would discontinue its integrated Usenet service in early 2005, citing the growing popularity of weblogs, chat forums and on-line conferencing. The AOL community had a tremendous role in popularizing Usenet some 11 years earlier, with all of its positive and negative aspects. This change marked the end of the legendary Eternal September. Others, however, feel that Google Groups, especially with its new user interface, has picked up the torch that AOL has dropped—and that the so-called Eternal September has yet to end.

1994 linuxjournal: March Linux 1.0 is released.
1994 linuxjournal: June While at a conference in New Orleans, Jon “maddog” Hall persuades Linus to port Linux to DEC's 64-bit Alpha computer processor chip. Less than two weeks later, maddog had also persuaded DEC to fund the project. An Alpha workstation was immediately sent to Linus. “Digital [DEC] and the Linux community formed the first truly successful venture of suits and Linux geeks working together”, said maddog.
1994 linuxjournal: June Linux International, a nonprofit vendor organization, is founded by Jon “maddog” Hall. Linux International goes on to become a major contributor to the success of Linux, helping corporations and others work toward the promotion of the Linux operating system.
1994 linuxjournal: August Linux trademark dispute: is Linux trademarked? William R. Della Croce, Jr. files for the trademark “Linux” on August 15, 1994, and it is registered in September. Della Croce has no known involvement in the Linux community yet sends letters out to prominent Linux companies demanding money for use of the trademark “Linux”. A lawsuit is filed in 1996 against Della Croce. Plai.pngfs in the suit include Linus Torvalds; Specialized Systems Consultants, Inc. (publishers of Linux Journal); Yggdrasil Computing, Inc.; Linux International; and WorkGroup Solutions (also known as LinuxMall). The plaintiffs prevail, and in 1997 announce the matter as settled by the assignment of the mark to Linus Torvalds on behalf of all Petitioners and Linux users.
1994 linuxjournal: September Linux is first mentioned in the mainstream press. Wired magazine features an article titled “Kernel Kid”, by Seth Rosenthal. He writes: “So, is Linus going to become the Bill Gates of Finland? Maybe not. He claims to be 'by no means a good student' and is in no hurry to graduate since 'Linux has taken a lot of time from my studies, and I like the work I have at the University which keeps me alive.”'
1994 linuxjournal: September Randolph Bentson reports on the world's first vendor-supported Linux device driver in Linux Journal. Cyclades gave him a multiport serial card in exchange for developing a Linux driver for it.

1995 linuxjournal: April Linux Expo, the first Linux-specific tradeshow and conference series, launches, thanks to the folks at North Carolina State University and in particular, Donnie Barnes. Speakers include Marc Ewing, Rik Faith and Michael K. Johnson, among others. Linux Expo snowballs and becomes the most popular and well-attended annual Linux show for the next several years (after three years Red Hat takes over organization and becomes the major sponsor). The price for entry into the exhibit hall and a pass to the conferences? $4.
1997 linuxjournal: January First “Linux virus” discovered. Called Bliss, it actually works on any UNIX-like OS and offers a helpful—“bliss-uninfect-files-please” command-line option. Alan Cox points out that Bliss “does not circumvent the security of the system, it relies on people with privilege to do something dumb” and reminds users to install digitally signed software from trustworthy sites only and to check signatures before installing.
1997 linuxjournal: January “In fact it's probably easier to write a virus for Linux because it's open source and the code is available. So we will be seeing more Linux viruses as the OS becomes more common and popular.” —Wishful thinking from McAfee
1998 linuxjournal: January Linux Weekly News begins publication with Jonathan Corbet and Elizabeth Coolbaugh as founders. The very first issue, dated January 22, was just a tiny hint of what LWN was to become.
1998 linuxjournal: January Netscape announces that they will release the source to their browser under a free software license. This almost certainly remains one of the most important events of the year; it opened a lot of eyes to what Linux and free software could provide.
1998 linuxjournal: January Red Hat Advanced Development Labs (RHAD) is founded. It has since become one of the higher-profile places where people are paid to develop free software and an important component of the GNOME Project. RHAD is able to attract developers like “Rasterman” (although only for a short time) and Federico Mena-Quintero.
1998 linuxjournal: February The Cobalt Qube is announced and immediately becomes a favorite in the trade press due to its high performance, low price and cute form factor. Cobalt's Linux engineering is done by none other than David Miller, the source of much that is good in the Linux kernel.
1998 linuxjournal: February The Linux user community wins InfoWorld's technical support award; Red Hat 5.0 also won their Operating System award. But it was the tech support award that truly opened some eyes; everybody had been saying that Linux had no support. This was the beginning of the end of the “no support” argument.
1998 linuxjournal: February Eric Raymond and friends come up with the term “open source”. They apply for trademark status and put up the opensource.org web site. Thus begins the formal effort to push Linux for corporate use.
1998 linuxjournal: March Consumer advocate Ralph Nader asks the large PC vendors (Dell, Gateway, Micron, etc.) to offer non-Microsoft systems, including systems with Linux installed.
1998 linuxjournal: April Linux is covered by the US National Public Radio news, marking one of its first appearances in the mainstream, nontechnical press.
1998 linuxjournal: April O'Reilly holds the “first ever” Free Software Summit, featuring Larry Wall, Brian Behlendorf, Linus Torvalds, Guido van Rossum, Eric Allman, Phil Zimmermann, Eric Raymond and Paul Vixie.
1998 linuxjournal: May The Google search engine pops up. Not only is it one of the best search engines around, but it's based on Linux and features a Linux-specific search page.

1998 linuxjournal: June “...these operating systems will not find widespread use in mainstream commercial applications in the next three years, nor will there be broad third-party application support.” —The Gartner Group says there is little hope for free software.
1998 linuxjournal: June A Datapro study comes out showing that Linux has the highest user satisfaction of any system; it also shows Linux to be the only system other than Microsoft Windows NT that is increasing its market share.
1998 linuxjournal: June IBM announces that it will distribute and support the Apache web server after working a deal with the Apache team.
1998 linuxjournal: July The desktop wars rage as KDE and GNOME advocates hurl flames at each other. Linus gets in on the act, saying that KDE is okay with him. In this context, KDE 1.0 is released. The first stable release of the K Desktop Environment proves to be popular, despite the complaints from those who do not like the licensing of the Qt library.
1998 linuxjournal: July Informix quietly releases software for Linux. Meanwhile, Oracle beats Informix to the punch PR-wise and makes a Linux-friendly announcement first, suggesting that they would soon be supporting Linux. Oracle promises to make a trial version available by the end of 1998, a deadline they beat by months. This, seemingly, was one of the acid tests for the potential of long-term success for Linux; a great deal of attention resulted from both Informix's and Oracle's announcements.
1998 linuxjournal: July Informix announces support for Linux effectively moments after Oracle does so. Sybase later announces their support for Linux also.
1998 linuxjournal: July Linus appears on the cover of Forbes magazine. A lengthy story presents Linux in a highly positive manner and brings the system to the attention of many who had never heard of it before. Linux begins to become a household word.
1998 linuxjournal: September LinuxToday.com is launched by Dave Whitinger and Dwight Johnson. The site, later acquired by Internet.com, arguably becomes the most well-read and visited Linux portal of all time.
1998 linuxjournal: September Microsoft's Steve Ballmer admits that they are “worried” about free software and suggests that some of the Windows NT source code may be made available to developers. The same month Microsoft goes on to list Linux as a competitive threat in its annual SEC (US Securities and Exchange Commission) filing. Speculation abounds that their real purpose is to influence the upcoming antitrust trial.
1998 linuxjournal: October “For the moment, however, the company from Redmond, Washington, seems almost grateful for the rising profile of Linux, seeing it as an easy way of demonstrating that Windows is not a monopoly, ahead of its antitrust trial, scheduled to begin on October 15. That may be short-sighted. In the long run, Linux and other open-source programs could cause Mr. Gates much grief.” —The Economist, October 3, 1998
1998 linuxjournal: October Intel and Netscape (and two venture capital firms) announce minority investments in Red Hat Software. The money is to be used to build an “enterprise support division” within Red Hat. An unbelievable amount of press is generated by this event, which is seen as a big-business endorsement of Linux.
1998 linuxjournal: October Corel announces that WordPerfect 8 for Linux will be downloadable for free for “personal use”. They also announce a partnership with Red Hat to supply Linux for the Netwinder.
1998 linuxjournal: December A report from IDC says that Linux shipments rose by more than 200% in 1998, and its market share rose by more than 150%. Linux has a 17% market share and a growth rate unmatched by any other system on the market.
1999 linuxjournal: January “Microsoft Corp. will shout it out to the world when Windows 2000 finally ships.

1999 linuxjournal: January Loki Entertainment Software announces that it will port Civilization: Call to Power to Linux.
1999 linuxjournal: February Linux and BSD users unite for “Windows Refund Day”. They visit Microsoft, hoping to return the unused Windows licenses that they were forced to acquire when they purchased a computer system bundled with the OS.
1999 linuxjournal: March “Like a Russian revolutionary erased from a photograph, he is being written out of history. Stallman is the originator of the Free Software movement and the GNU/Linux operating system. But you wouldn't know it from reading about LinuxWorld (Expo). Linus Torvalds got all the ink.” —Leander Kahney, Wired magazine, March 1999
1999 linuxjournal: March The first LinuxWorld Conference and Expo is held in San Jose, California. As the first big commercial “tradeshow” event for Linux, it serves notice to the world that Linux has arrived; 12,000 people are said to have attended.
1999 linuxjournal: March Linux Magazine debuts, bringing some additional competition to the Linux print business. Later, other magazines rise and fall including Open, Journal of Linux Technology (JOLT) and Maximum Linux.
1999 linuxjournal: March VA Research buys the Linux.com domain for $1,000,000 and announces plans to turn it into a Linux portal. Microsoft's rumored bid for the domain is frustrated.
1999 linuxjournal: April “...please imagine what it is like to see an idealistic project stymied and made ineffective because people don't usually give it the credit for what it has done. If you're an idealist like me, that can ruin your whole decade.” —Richard Stallman on GNU/Linux
1999 linuxjournal: April Al Gore's presidential campaign web site claims to be open source. That claim is gone, but the site still claims: “In the spirit of the Open Source movement, we have established the Gore 2000 Volunteer Source Code Project; www.algore2000.com is an 'open site'.“
1999 linuxjournal: April HP announces 24/7 support services for the Caldera, Turbolinux, Red Hat and SuSE distributions. They also release OpenMail for Linux.
1999 linuxjournal: April The Linux FreeS/WAN Project releases a free IPSec implementation, allowing Linux to function as a VPN gateway using what is now the industry standard.
1999 linuxjournal: April “But the mere fact that there is now an official SEC document that includes the text of the GPL serves as fairly astonishing proof that the rules of the software business really are being rewritten.” —Andrew Leonard, Salon
1999 linuxjournal: May “Those two little words—open source—have become a magical incantation, like portal in 1998 or push in 1997. Just whisper them and all will be yours: media attention, consumer interest and, of course, venture capital.” —Andrew Leonard, Wired
1999 linuxjournal: August First Intel IA-64 “Merced” silicon. Although Intel had given simulators to several OS vendors, Linux is the only OS to run on the new architecture on its first day. The Register headline: “Merced silicon happens: Linux runs, NT doesn't”.

1999 linuxjournal: August Red Hat's initial public offering happens; a last-minute repricing helps to create difficulties for people participating in the community offering. The stock price immediately rises to $50; a value that seems high at the time.
1999 linuxjournal: August “For the umpteenth time, someone paved paradise, put up a parking lot. For the thousands of Linux coders who've built the utopian open-source movement—offering free help to create a free operating system—the IPO of Red Hat Software was a sure sign of Wall Street cutting the ribbon on the new Linux mall.” —The Industry Standard
1999 linuxjournal: August Motorola jumps into Linux announcements of embedded systems products, support and training services, and a partnership with Lineo.

'I suppose Red Hat's business model makes sense to somebody, but it makes no sense to us', he says.” —Daniel Lyons, Forbes, May 31, 1999. Then in September, Burlington ended up purchasing support from Red Hat.  The first big Linux stock rush happens. Shares in Applix more than double in volume, reaching nearly 27 million shares—three times the 9 million shares that are actually on the market.
1999 linuxjournal: September SCO trashes Linux in a brochure distributed in Northern Europe: “Linux at this moment can be considered more a plaything for IT students rather than a serious operating system in which to place the functioning, security and future of a business. Because Linux is basically a free-for-all it means that no individual person/company is accountable should anything go wrong, plus there is no way to predict which way Linux will evolve.”
1999 linuxjournal: September Stock in Red Hat hits $135/share. The price seems unbelievably high at the time.
1999 linuxjournal: October Sun Microsystems announces that it will release the source to Solaris under the Sun Community Source License. The actual release drew criticism: “In a move aimed at Linux, Sun said it will announce Wednesday that it is making the source code for its new Solaris 8 operating system 'open'. Webster's has lots of definitions for the word, including 'not sealed, fastened, or locked'. But when you dig into the details of Sun's announcement, you'll find that what it is offering doesn't come close to meeting the dictionary's definition, let alone that of the Open Source movement.” —Lawrence Aragon, Redherring.com, January 26, 2000
1999 linuxjournal: November “...if there's one thing about Linux users, they're do-ers, not whiners.” —Andy Patrizio,

2000 linuxjournal: February Red Hat wins InfoWorld's “Product of the Year” award for the fourth time in a row.
2000 linuxjournal: March “The law in open code means that no actor can gain ultimate control over open-source code. Even the kings can't get ultimate control over the code. For example, if Linus Torvalds, father of the Linux kernel, tried to steer GNU/Linux in a way that others in the community rejected, then others in the community could always have removed the offending part and gone in a different way. This threat constrains the kings; they can only lead where they know the people will follow.” —“Innovation, Regulation, and the Internet” by Lawrence Lessig for The American Prospect.
2000 linuxjournal: March A new version of LILO is posted that is able to get past the 1024-cylinder boot limit that has plagued PC systems for years.

2000 linuxjournal: April Code is ruled to be speech. On April 4, 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit published its decision regarding Peter Junger's challenge to the Export Administration Regulations that prevented him from posting information on the Internet that contained cryptographic example code. Most critical in the ruling: “Because computer source code is an expressive means for the exchange of information and ideas about computer programming, we hold that it is protected by the First Amendment.”
2000 linuxjournal: April Andy Tanenbaum releases the the Minix operating system under the BSD license. Had Minix been open source from the beginning, Linux may never have happened.
2000 linuxjournal: May SuSE releases the first supported Linux distribution for the IBM S/390 mainframe.
2000 linuxjournal: May “Approximately 140 distribution companies exist across the globe. We believe all but the top five will be bought, will go out of business or will be relegated to insignificance. Market-share leaders are currently defined around geographic boundaries. Red Hat has the largest global brand recognition and leading North American market share; SuSE leads in Europe, Turbolinux leads in Asia, and Conectiva leads in South America.” —Keith Bachman, an analyst for WR Hambrecht, predicting in The Red Herring
2000 linuxjournal: June Commercial considerations help prompt the relicensing of MySQL under the GPL.

In addition, Progress Software forms a new company, NuSphere, just for the purpose of supporting MySQL.
2000 linuxjournal: July “In a world of NDA-bound business agreements, Debian is an open book. In a world of mission statements, Debian has a social contract. At a time when commercial distributors are striving to see how much proprietary software they can pack into a box of Linux, Debian remains the bastion of software freedom—living proof that you can have a fully functional and usable operating system without needing any proprietary code.” —Evan Leibovitch, ZDNet
2000 linuxjournal: July Sun announces that StarOffice is to be released under the GPL. The code is going to be reworked, integrated with Bonobo and GTK, and released as a set of reusable components. StarOffice will also be reworked to use a set of open XML-based file formats.
2000 linuxjournal: July Oracle's Linux-based internet appliance system hits the shelves. The “New Internet Computer” (NIC) is the latest result of Larry Ellison's long personal crusade to make non-Microsoft systems available to the world. It's aimed at people who only want access to the Net; as such, it's essentially a $199 (without monitor) X terminal.
2000 linuxjournal: July Reports first appear that SCO may be purchased by Caldera. Later in 2000 Caldera and SCO announce their intent for Caldera International to be formed from Caldera's existing operation and two of SCO's three divisions.

2000 linuxjournal: September “I'm a bastard. I have absolutely no clue why people can ever think otherwise. Yet they do. People think I'm a nice guy, and the fact is that I'm a scheming, conniving bastard who doesn't care for any hurt feelings or lost hours of work if it just results in what I consider to be a better system.” —Linus Torvalds trying to change his image.
2000 linuxjournal: September The RSA patent expires, allowing for secure web transactions without proprietary software.
2000 linuxjournal: September Trolltech releases the Qt library under the GPL, putting a definitive end to a long-running and unpleasant license flame war.
2000 linuxjournal: September The CueCat fiasco begins. Digital Convergence attempts to shut down programmers who have written Linux drivers for its CueCat bar code scanner. The company has given out large numbers of these scanners for free, expecting people to use them with its proprietary software and web site. The threats cause the drivers to become marginally harder to find for a short period, after which the company declares victory and moves on.
2000 linuxjournal: October Microsoft says that penguins can mutate in a European print ad that quickly becomes famous.
2000 linuxjournal: December “I was dumbfounded to discover that installing Linux was easy. Why? Well, the world has changed. No more do you have to understand everything about Linux before you install it, downloading the many chunks of code necessary to run a complete system and getting them all to work together. That was BSW—before shrink-wrap. With companies such as Red Hat and Corel putting all the software you need in a box, the pain is (nearly) gone.” —John Schwartz, Washington Post

2001 linuxjournal: June “In a press release issued Wednesday afternoon, VA Linux CEO Larry M. Augustin called the shift in strategy a logical move. 'Our differentiating strength has always been our software expertise', Augustin said”. —Wired. You only thought VA was a hardware company.
2001 linuxjournal: July Free Dmitry! Dmitry Sklyarov is arrested in Las Vegas after Adobe complains about the Advanced eBook Processor. The following month he is charged with DMCA violations and conspiracy: the potential penalties add up to 25 years in prison. Dmitry's defense is based on constitutional challenges to the DMCA, on free speech and jurisdictional issues. Later in the year, charges are dropped, conditional on one year of good behavior and testimony in the ElcomSoft trial.
2001 linuxjournal: July “Although Adobe withdrew its support for the criminal complaint against Dmitry Sklyarov, we respect the grand jury and federal government's decision to prosecute the company, ElcomSoft, and as a law-abiding corporate citizen, Adobe intends to cooperate fully with the government as required by law.” —Adobe's position

1993 debian: Among GNU/Linux distributions, Debian GNU/Linux, begun by Ian Murdock, is noteworthy for being explicitly committed to the GNU and FSF principles of free software.
1994 debian: The Debian project switched to calling itself "GNU/Linux" in early 1994;[4] Debian founder Ian Murdock later noted that this change was made in response to a request by Richard Stallman (who initially proposed "Lignux," but suggested "GNU/Linux" instead after hearing complaints about the awkwardness of the former term).
1997 debian: the Debian project published their Debian Free Software Guidelines.

1985 gcc: Richard Stallman started GCC. He extended an existing compiler to compile C. The compiler originally compiled Pastel, an extended, nonportable dialect of Pascal, and was written in Pastel.
1987 gcc: GCC released in 1987 as the compiler for the GNU Project, in order to have a compiler available that was free software.
1991 gcc: GCC 1.x had reached a point of stability, but architectural limitations prevented many desired improvements, so the Free Software Foundation (FSF) started work on GCC 2.x.
1997 gcc: a group of developers formed EGCS, to merge several experimental forks into a single project. The basis of the merger was a gcc development snapshot taken between the 2.7 and 2.81 releases. Projects merged included g77 (Fortran), PGCC (Pentium-optimized GCC), many C++ improvements, and many new architectures and operating system variants.
1999 gcc: FSF officially halted development on their GCC 2.x compiler, "blessed" EGCS as the official version. the project explicitly adopted the "bazaar" model over the "cathedral" model.
2001 gcc: GCC 3.0 released.
2005 gcc: GCC 4.0 released.

1988 glibc: FSF described glibc as having nearly completed the functionality required by ANSI C.
1996 glibc: FSF released glibc 2.0 in 1996, it had much more complete POSIX standards support, better internationalisation/multilingual support, support for IPv6, 64-bit data access, support for multithreaded applications, future version compatibility support, and the code was more portable.

1993 bsd: FreeBSD 1.0 released http://www.freebsd.org/releases/index.html
1995 bsd: OpenBSD forked from NetBSD
1993 bsd: When the USL v. BSDi lawsuit was settled out of court in 1993, FreeBSD and NetBSD (both derived from 386BSD) were released as free software.

2004 gdb: 6.3 released. (We rock!)
1986 gdb: GDB was first written by Richard Stallman in 1986 as part of his GNU system, after his GNU Emacs was "reasonably stable".

1992 gnu: linux is used as kernel.
1994 gnu: Stallman's and the FSF's efforts to include "GNU" in the name started around 1994, but were reportedly mostly via private communications (such as the abovementioned request to Debian) until 1996.
1991 gnu: The GNU project's kernel, later called "GNU Hurd", was continually delayed, but most other components were completed by 1991. Some of these, especially the GNU Compiler Collection, had become market leaders in their own right. The GNU Debugger and GNU Emacs were also notable successes.

1991 gpl: A slightly updated version 2 was published
1989 gpl: the first version of the GNU General Public License was published

2006 graphics: Xgl was originally developed on public mailing lists, but for a long time, until January 2, 2006 most [2] development of Xgl was done behind closed doors. On that day the source to Xgl was re-opened to the public [3][4], and included in freedesktop.org, along with major restructuring to allow a wider range of supported display drivers.

2004 javascript: Ecma International published ECMA-357 standard, defining an extension to ECMAScript, known as E4X (ECMAScript for XML).
1997 javascript: Edition 1; First edition ECMA-262, editor Guy L. Steele, Jr.

1995 javascript: JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape under the name Mocha, later LiveScript, and finally renamed to JavaScript. In December 1995 Sun Microsystems and Netscape announced JavaScript in a press release.
1996 javascript: Microsoft named its dialect of the language JScript to avoid trademark issues. JScript was first supported in Internet Explorer version 3.0, released in August 1996, and it included Y2K-compliant date functions, unlike those based on java.util.Date in JavaScript at the time.
1996 javascript: Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International for standardization resulting in the standardized version named ECMAScript.

1996 kde: KDE was founded in 1996 by Matthias Ettrich.
